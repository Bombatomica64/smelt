if i need to tell you something multiple time put it here

## Generated Rust diagnostics
when working on generated Rust warnings or blockers, use:
`cargo run --bin smelt -- rust-diagnostics --cargo-manifest <generated-crate>/Cargo.toml --output blocker-logs/<name>.md`
This produces a grouped Markdown report sorted by diagnostic count so LLMs can start with the biggest warning/error classes.

## Generated Rust incremental builds
the Rust emitter intentionally preserves generated file mtimes by writing files only when their bytes change. This lets Cargo reuse incremental artifacts for large generated crates. Do not replace this with unconditional `fs::write`, and avoid touching/regenerating generated Rust files unless their contents actually changed.

## Style
put docstrings in modules and functions

## Rust codegen
keep Rust source emission helpers in separate modules so codegen can be refactored incrementally
document Rust codegen helper functions carefully because unclear helpers make LLM-generated changes worse
if a codegen feature becomes too large, prefer well-known Rust libraries that are likely familiar to LLMs over custom machinery

## Refactoring timing
finish active feature phases before broad codebase division refactors unless a small split is clearly low-risk and directly reduces current-file growth
put new feature code into existing focused modules where practical, then do a deliberate architecture pass after the feature phase stabilizes

## Frontend validation boundaries
when `tsc` or Python compile/type checks would reject invalid source before Smelt runs, it is ok for HIR/MIR to use interchangeable internal representations such as Map and Record sharing Dict
do not block useful mappings only because source spelling is erased internally; keep frontend checks/tests for shapes Smelt can cheaply validate itself

## Type lowering
WE DO NOT DO SPECIAL CASES FOR CODE, everything must lower through general rules, except test functions
qualified type references must preserve or resolve the full alias path instead of blindly turning `Namespace.Member` into `Class(Member)`

## NEVERS

NEVER reject a feature without asking me first, it doesn't matter how hard it is
