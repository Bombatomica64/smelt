# SMELT

> Smelt your TypeScript and Python into Rust.

**smelt** is a transpiler that takes strictly-typed TypeScript and Python source code and compiles it down to idiomatic Rust. The goal is not to transpile *all* TS/Python — it is to transpile the statically-typed subset where types actually mean something.

## Why

TypeScript and Python both have rich, expressive type systems that are mostly used for editor tooling and runtime validation. smelt takes those types seriously: if your code is fully typed and passes strict checks, smelt can lower it through a shared intermediate representation and emit Rust that compiles, runs, and is reasonably idiomatic.

The long-term vision is **language-interchangeable modules**: a Python file importing from a TypeScript file, both lowering to the same HIR, both becoming the same Rust crate.

## Status

Pre-alpha. See the milestones in github issues for the v1.0 roadmap.

Current external test milestone: Smelt can compile the focused
`date-fns/date-fns` `quartersToMonths` slice, including its Vitest test file,
into a generated Rust crate whose `cargo test` run passes. The probed files are:

- `src/constants/index.ts`
- `src/quartersToMonths/index.ts`
- `src/quartersToMonths/test.ts`

This is the first real third-party TypeScript test slice where source-language
tests lower into native Rust `#[test]` functions and pass under Cargo.

## v1.0 Goals

- A real Express app (TypeScript, strict mode) compiles to a working `axum` server.
- A real FastAPI app (Python, fully typed, passes `ty`) compiles to a working `axum` server.
- Both produce structurally similar Rust output, validating the shared HIR design.
- Configuration via `Smelt.toml`, CLI modeled after `cargo`.

## Non-Goals (for v1.0)

- LSP / editor integration.
- Ownership/borrow inference (v1.0 clones aggressively).
- Supporting dynamic features (`eval`, `getattr`, monkey-patching, `any`).
- Multiple Rust web framework backends. v1.0 targets `axum` only.
- Incremental compilation.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
TypeScript ──┐                                      ┌── Rust source
             ├──> Frontend ──> HIR ──> MIR ──> Codegen
Python ──────┘                                      └── Cargo.toml (generated)
```

See `specs/architecture.md` for the full picture.
